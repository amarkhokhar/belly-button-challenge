# belly-button-challenge

This challenge examines different types of bacteria that are within different individual's belly buttons. Different characteristics about the individual were stored, such as location, gender, age, ethnicity, and bellybutton type (inny or outty). The project focuses on two types of visualizations and one summary of the metadata of each individual.

Visualization 1 is a horizontal barchart that focuses on creating a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs(bacteria) found in an individual. 

Visualization 2 is a bubble chart that uses the same variables and dropdown capabilities. Once the individual is selected it will visualize bubbles based on the OTUs and graphically change the size according to the count. 

Lastly, there is a table that displays the metadata from the json file of all the characterisitics for that individual.
